# Graph Algorithms Project

## Overview
This project implements a Graph class and various graph algorithms in C++. It includes functionality for graph operations.

## Files
- `Graph.hpp` & `Graph.cpp`: Define and implement the Graph class.
- `Algorithms.hpp` & `Algorithms.cpp`: Contain graph algorithm implementations.
- `Test.cpp`: Contains unit tests for the Graph class and algorithms.

## Graph Class
The Graph class represents a graph using an adjacency matrix. It supports both directed and undirected graphs.

### Key Features
- Graph creation and manipulation
- Overloaded operators for graph operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
- Comparison operators

## Algorithms
The project implements the following graph algorithms:

1. `isConnected`: Checks if the graph is connected.
2. `shortestPath`: Finds the shortest path between two vertices.
3. `isContainsCycle`: Detects if the graph contains a cycle.
4. `isBipartite`: Determines if the graph is bipartite.
5. `negativeCycle`: Checks for the presence of a negative cycle.
